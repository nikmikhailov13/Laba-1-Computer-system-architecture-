# Ptenec File Manager

*I am glad to see that you use my program. It is actually my first one!
But anyway it could be a little bit tricky.*

*That's why I decided to add some instructions about usage of this marvelous app.
First of all, I'd like to clarify the things. It is just a file manager, and you unlikely are able
hack into the Pentagon with "Ptenec".  
The main purpose is working with files.*


*When you launch "Ptenec" **AT THE FIRST TIME**, go to the settings and select default disks.
They will be shown every time when you start the app. If you want to change them - it's up to you.
Just go again to the settings.
Don't forget to restart the program.*

*All available functions of the program you can find on the bottom of the window or inside the topmenu. *
