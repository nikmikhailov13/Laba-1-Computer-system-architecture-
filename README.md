# Ptenec File Manager

I am glad to see that you use my program. It is actually my first one!
But anyway it could be a little bit tricky. 

That's why I decided to add some instructions about usage of this marvelous app.
First of all, I'd like to clarify the things. It is just a file manager, and you unlikely are able
hack into the Pentagon with "Ptenec".  
The main purpose is working with files.

___

WHEN YOU LAUNCH "Ptenec" AT THE FIRST TIME, go to the settings and select default disks.
They will be shown every time when you start the app. If you want to change them - it's up to you.
Just go again to the settings.
Don't forget to restart the program.
